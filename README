Colour Schemes
==============

This repository contains some colour schemes I have created for use in various applications. I figured I'd provide them to others as well in case anyone finds them useful. This file has a quick overview of what's included. In addition, there are some screenshots. I will continue to update these themes if required, and add to them with new/updated themes. 

Vibrant Pastel
--------------
This theme uses light pastel colours on a black semi-transparent background. It was originally based on the 'Pro' terminal theme which is provided with OS X.

Provided theme files:
- Textmate
- OS X Terminal

Blackboard2
-----------

This is a terminal theme designed to work with a modified version of the blackboard theme supplied with Textmate.

Provided theme files:
- OS X Terminal

Notes
-----

My terminal themes for OS X terminal work best with terminal colours turned on. They also work very well with a coloured prompt. My .bash_profile for enabling these features looks like this:

export CLICOLOR=1
export PS1="\[\e[0;32m\]\u@\h \W$\[\e[0m\] "

These themes are supplied as-is with no warranty express or implied. That said, feel free to do whatever you like with/to them.
